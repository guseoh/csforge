# CSForge Agent Instructions

## 1. Product goal
CSForge is a local-first, single-user CS/backend learning application built primarily through Codex-assisted development.

The product exists to make daily learning convenient: learn concepts, solve questions, review wrong answers, schedule review, search accumulated knowledge, and import content in bulk.

Primary flow:

`Dashboard -> Learning Areas -> Concept -> Quiz -> Result -> Wrong Notes -> Review -> Search`

Content management flow:

`Markdown/JSON -> Validate -> Preview/Diff -> Import -> PostgreSQL -> async indexing`

## 2. Current hard constraints
- Local-only V1. No cloud deployment.
- Single user. No Member domain, signup, login, OAuth, JWT, roles, or Spring Security unless a later task explicitly changes this.
- No desktop/laptop data synchronization in V1.
- PostgreSQL is the source of truth. Elasticsearch, Redis, and Kafka data must be rebuildable or recoverable from canonical data/events.
- Keep the app usable even when optional derived infrastructure such as search/cache is unavailable where practical.
- Do not introduce paid infrastructure or services as a requirement.

## 3. Baseline stack
Backend:
- Java 25
- Spring Boot 4.1.x
- Gradle
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- Bean Validation
- Flyway
- Spring Kafka
- Spring AI when AI features are implemented
- Actuator / Micrometer

Frontend:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- PWA
- TanStack Router
- TanStack Query
- React Hook Form
- Zod

Local infrastructure:
- PostgreSQL
- Elasticsearch with Nori for Korean search
- Kafka
- Redis
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Docker Compose

Later infrastructure may include ClickHouse, OpenTelemetry, Loki, and Tempo when their actual product/observability responsibilities are implemented. Do not add them merely as empty dependencies.

## 4. Repository shape
Prefer a simple monorepo:

```text
csforge/
├─ backend/
├─ frontend/
├─ content/
├─ infra/
├─ docs/
└─ compose.yaml
```

Start with one Spring Boot application. Keep domain/module boundaries clear enough to split runtime responsibilities later, but do not create separate API/worker applications or duplicate Gradle projects without an actual need.

Suggested backend feature packages:
- learning
- question
- quiz
- review
- note
- search
- ai
- importcontent
- dashboard
- global

Avoid ceremonial layers and abstractions that do not protect a real boundary.

## 5. Engineering rule: do not intentionally build a weak first version
Do not omit normal application quality just because the task is called MVP.

When applicable from the first implementation, include:
- pagination
- filtering
- sorting
- stable ordering
- reasonable page-size limits
- database indexes derived from known query patterns
- uniqueness and foreign-key constraints
- idempotent imports
- bulk operations for bulk workflows
- retry/recovery where a workflow can reasonably fail
- autosave/resume for frequently used learning flows
- useful loading, empty, and error states
- keyboard/search convenience where it materially improves daily use

For append-heavy/history data, consider cursor/keyset pagination rather than forcing offset pagination everywhere. For Elasticsearch deep paging, design with `search_after` when appropriate.

Performance measurement is used to validate and refine an already reasonable design, not to justify intentionally shipping missing pagination/indexes first.

## 6. Engineering rule: avoid unnecessary and repetitive work
The previous rule is not permission to over-engineer.

Avoid unless a task has a concrete reason:
- duplicate applications/modules that repeat configuration
- every-CRUD-is-an-event designs
- generic abstractions used by only one case
- speculative frameworks or libraries with no product responsibility
- duplicated DTO/domain models without a boundary that requires them
- documentation that repeats existing canonical documentation without adding a decision or contract
- tests that only mirror implementation details and provide no behavior confidence

Use the smallest structure that cleanly supports the currently approved behavior.

## 7. Core V1 domain rules
- Learning structure: `LearningArea -> Topic -> Concept`.
- Concept levels are `1`, `2`, `3`.
- Question difficulty is separate from Concept level.
- A Question should be connected to at least one Concept.
- Wrong notes are grouped by Question, while every Attempt remains historical data.
- V1 spaced review operates on Questions with the baseline sequence `1d -> 3d -> 7d -> 14d`; a wrong review returns to the first stage.
- A correct answer may still enter review when the user explicitly marks `review needed`.
- AI output is supporting information, not canonical answer/content data.
- AI-generated questions enter Draft/Review before becoming canonical Question data.
- Content imports use stable external/content keys and must be idempotent.

## 8. Search and async rules
- PostgreSQL owns canonical Concept, Question, Note, Attempt, WrongNote, Review, and AI-analysis records.
- Elasticsearch owns search projections only.
- Kafka is for workflows that benefit from asynchronous processing, such as search indexing, AI analysis, and analytics events. Do not route simple synchronous CRUD through Kafka without a reason.
- When DB state and Kafka publication must stay consistent, use a transactional outbox rather than dual writes.

## 9. Codex task workflow
For every task:
1. Read this file and relevant docs before changing code.
2. Inspect the current repository state; do not assume previous prompts were applied.
3. Make only the delta required by the current task plus directly necessary supporting changes.
4. Preserve existing decisions unless the task explicitly changes them.
5. Run the smallest meaningful validation first, then the broader project validation appropriate to the change.
6. Report changed behavior, validation results, and any remaining limitation briefly.
7. Do not commit, push, open a PR, or modify unrelated files unless the task explicitly asks for it.

Prefer one complete vertical change over repeated tiny edits that create avoidable churn.
